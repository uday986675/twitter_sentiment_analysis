🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes tweets to determine the sentiment behind them — whether they express positive, negative, or neutral opinions. The goal is to understand public mood on a given topic, uncover patterns in social media discussions, and demonstrate practical applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in real-world data.

🔹 Features

Collect and preprocess tweets (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF / Word Embeddings.

Build and evaluate machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.).

Experiment with deep learning (LSTMs / Transformers) for improved accuracy.

Visualize sentiment trends with word clouds and sentiment distribution plots.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK/spacy, matplotlib, seaborn

Deep Learning (optional): TensorFlow / PyTorch

🔹 Potential Use Cases

Track public opinion on brands, products, or political events.

Monitor market sentiment for trading strategies.

Social media trend analysis.
